## Overview

This project was developed as part of a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) exercise.  
My approach for this challenge included adding a dynamic results table that displays each play and maintains a total score count for Heads and Tails.

### What I learned

This challenge helped me refresh several core vanilla JavaScript concepts I hadn't used much lately, since most of my recent work has involved frameworks. Key takeaways include:

- Revisiting `getElementById`, `appendChild`, and `createElement`.
- Using `insertBefore()` to dynamically insert a node as the first child within a specified parent element.
- Managing class-based visibility toggles for better UI control.

### Built with

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- **CSS** custom properties
- **Flexbox**
- Vanilla **JavaScript**

## Features

- Coin flip simulation
- Displays result images and labels (Heads or Tails)
- Running history of results with most recent at the top
- Simple, responsive layout
